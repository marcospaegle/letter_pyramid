# Challenge Assignment - Letter Pyramid
 
Display a Letter Pyramid given a string of characters. A very small but challenging C++ program that displays a Letter Pyramid from a user-provided string.
The user will enter a string and then from that string display a Letter Pyramid as follows (It's much easier to understand the Letter Pyramid given examples):
If the user enters the string "ABC", then your program should display:
```
  A
 ABA
ABCBA
```
